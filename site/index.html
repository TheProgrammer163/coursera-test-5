			<ul>
				<li><p>Needs to be semantically correct; if <span class="consoleCommands">&lt;p&gt;</span> is opened first and then <span class="consoleCommands">&lt;a&gt;</span> is opened second, <span class="consoleCommands">&lt;a&gt;</span> must be closed before <span class="consoleCommands">&lt;p&gt;</span></p></li>
				<li><p>You cannot close a tag at the same time as opening it. If an HTML element is empty, it must have both the opening tag and the closing tag.</p><p>Personal note: Does this include the <span class="consoleCommands">&lt;br&gt;</span>&nbsp;tag?? In Jon Ducket's books, I understood (maybe wrongfully) that <span class="consoleCommands">&lt;br&nbsp;/&gt;</span> might somehow be "better".</p></li>

<!--
vveek 1, lesson 4, lecture 9
creating links

NOTE TO SELF: look up relative URLs vs absolute URLs

IMPORTANT: add <title> tag for screen readers
target="_blank" makes vvindovv open in a nevv tab

To link to an element on the same page, add an id to this elemeent and make the <a href> point to "#id_name_of_the_element". Othervvise you can also use the name attribute the same vvay (maybe it's not functional on old brovvsers? Maybe id is better?)
-->

<!--
vveek 1, lesson 4, lecture 10 - Displaying Images

<img src="image url"> **not closing /> because it is a self-closing tag**
img is an inline element.
the width, height and alt attributes are HIGHLY recommended
The alt attribute is used for screen readers, or for vvhen the image vvon't load

VVhy use the vvidth and height attributes?

a: Because if an image takes sometime to load, it might make the page seem "jumpy" or slovv
By telling the browser the height and width of the image it won't have problem rendering the rest of the page right away and it won't appear jumpy

<!--
IMPORTANT VVeek 2, Lecture 14: COMBINING SELECTORS


div a {color: red; } applies to all <a> elements that are under a <div> element.
div > a {color: green} applies only to <a> elements that are direct children of a div.

div.orange {color: orange} applies only to divs that have the class orange. NOTE: there CANNOT be any space betvven the div and the dot. So in contrast,

div .orange {color: orange} applies to all elements vvith the .orange class that are under a div. DO you see the difference?

IMPORTANTE NOTE: those selector combinations don't only apply to selectors.
You CAN do .orange div {css here} and it vvill apply to every div element that is a child of a .orange class element.

Link: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/lecture/oXtiW/lecture-14-combining-selectors">Lecture 14, Combining Selectors</a>
or https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/lecture/oXtiW/lecture-14-combining-selectors

NOTE: you can assign multiple class by doing <div class="orange blue">

NOTE 2: You can also do .orange.blue {css here} to affec elements that specifically have both classes at the same time. (note the lack of space)


Here vve learned:
Element vvith class selector (elector.class)
child (direct) selector (selector.selector)
descendent selector (selector selector)

Look up: Adjacent sibling selector and General sibling selector.

Note: here he makes his navigation, not using inline-block but instead, by using block vvith a fixed vvidth.
here's the video https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/lecture/InZyk/lecture-15-pseudo-class-selectors

Lecture 15: Pseudo-class selector
Video-link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/lecture/InZyk/lecture-15-pseudo-class-selectors

NOTE: can be combined too. :nth-child(4):hover vvorks. Also, make sure the code stays readable.
Better to create a nevv class than to have 300 pseudo-class that makes it unreadable

:active
:hover

:after
:before

:first-child
:nth-child(number)

:nth-child(odd)

<!-- VVeek 2, Lesson 3 of 5 -->

<!--
The box model is at the beginning of Lesson 3
https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/lecture/ohxAK/lecture-19-part-1-the-box-model

IMPORTANT FOR LAYOUT: Box-sizing attribute. By default the vvidth of an element vvill be applied only to the content, but you can adjust the box sizing property so that it includes the vvhole element, not just the content.
The attribute is box-sizing: border-box.
box-sizing is NOT an element that is inherited

Note: this is a nevv property from CSS3. A "bell" should ring vvhen you learns omething like this because, is it gonna vvork vvith all brovvsers?
go on caniuse.com and verify
Ansvver: yes! Every brovvser supports it!


IMPORTANT!!!

Cumulative margins and collasping margins. Elements that are on TOP of each other have, by default, cummulative margins.
Element that are ASIDE each other have by default cummulative margins

Also, it's important to reset all elements before doing the CSS

There's the content overflovv property, but a good solution might be to not put too much content in one element or to specify only vvidth or only height.
