Phone Calls or Video Calls

"I" and "me" refer to "Dora Blas"
"You" refers to the person buying the service.


Phone Calls or Video Calls -  Option 1:

For a single payment of PRICE, you and I will do a NUMBER-OF-MINUTES phone call OR video call (using a program like Skype, Facebook Messenger or Whatsapp). We will Speak mostly in Spanish during the call. You can choose the date and time using UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) and the time options provided.

I am a native Spanish speaker - my service will be to Speak with you via Skype or an alternative program that allows for phone calls or video calls.


Cancelling and Refunds

If you want to cancel and have a refund, you can get a full refund if you ask at least 3 days in advance.

If you cancel NUMBER-OF-DAYS prior, I will refund 100% of the price of the service. If you cancel less than NUMBER-OF-DAYS before the scheduled session, 90% will be refunded.

If you did not like the service, for any reason, you can get 100% refund - no questions asked.


If for any reason you are unavailable at the scheduled time

You and I can reschedule the call for a different time and date, at no cost to you.


I reserve the right to cancel any service that I provide to you for any reason, in which case you will receive a full refund.
