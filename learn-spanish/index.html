					<h2>The problem with universities</h2>
					<p>When learning a language, in school, colleges or universities, it's not always enough. We don't practice speaking the language we learn that often.</p>
					<h4>We don't learn informal speech</h4>
					<p>The focus is not on informal speech, so we end out talking like robots. We don't speak the same way with friends than we do in a professionnal setting. If we do not learn to speak informally, we cannot speak naturally.</p>
					<h4>Univerisites teach too slow. They aren't enough.</h4>
					<p>You write a text, your Spanish teacher takes it but has a ton of copies to correct. A week or two later you see your results and the mistakes you made.<br>This is a slow process. When practicing speaking, this is once in while. It isn't a 1 on 1 where you only speak Spanish. It isn't as intense and effective as speaking with a native speaker of that language, only in that language, for 30 minutes in a row.</p>
					<h2>Our solution</h2>
				</div>
			</div><!-- .row -->
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<h3>Practice Speaking Through Phone or Video Calls</h3>
					<p>We offer two services. Correction of a text your write on a daily basis. You write a text of 200 words, send it in the morning. 24 hours later you see the correction WITH explainations on why something you wrote was incorrect and what are better expressions to use. With detailed explainations on what makes something "sound right" or "sound wrong" in what you wrote. This will keep you from doing the same mistakes again.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<h3>Correction of texts</h3>
					<p>You don't have to write a text of 500 words once in a while with your university, waiting two weeks to see your results and what you did wrong.</p>
					<p>With this service, you</p>

					<p>Skype session</p>
					<p>Practice your Spanish speaking skills via Skype. Have a phone or video call where you will speak almost exclusively in Spanish, to help you improve. To really learn a language, you have to practice speaking it.</p>
