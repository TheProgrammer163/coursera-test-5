					<h2>The problem with universities</h2>
					<p>When learning a language, in school, colleges or universities, it's not always enough. We don't practice speaking the language we learn that often.</p>
					<h4>We don't learn informal speech</h4>
					<p>The focus is not on informal speech, so we end out talking like robots. We don't speak the same way with friends than we do in a professionnal setting. If we do not learn to speak informally, we cannot speak naturally.</p>
					<h4>Univerisites teach too slow. They aren't enough.</h4>
					<p>You write a text, your Spanish teacher takes it but has a ton of copies to correct. A week or two later you see your results and the mistakes you made.<br>This is a slow process. When practicing speaking, this is once in while. It isn't a 1 on 1 where you only speak Spanish. It isn't as intense and effective as speaking with a native speaker of that language, only in that language, for 30 minutes in a row.</p>

					<h2>Our solution</h2>
					<h4>We offer two types of services:</h4>
					<p> - Phone calls and video calls to practice your speaking skills
					<br> - Correction of texts, to help you create phrases that are correct and "sound right".</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<h3>Phone Calls or Video Calls in Spanish</h3>
					<p>One service we offer is a phone call or video call, using a software like <span class="st-otherCompanyBrand">Skype</span>, <span class="st-otherCompanyBrand">Whatsapp</span> or <span class="st-otherCompanyBrand">Facebook Menssenger</span>. The goal of this is to speak almost entirely in Spanish the entire time. One of the best thing you can do to learn a language is to immerse yourself in it. Without travelling, this is hard to do. With a phone or video call you can practice in a similar way.</p>
					<p>Speaking is essential to become fluent. Don't try to become fluent so that you can speak, speak so that you become fluent. You will improve much faster.</p>

					<h3>Daily Spanish Text</h3>
					<p>In univerisities, you get writing tests. You write a 500 word essay, the teacher corrects it and a week or two later you see the corrections your teacher made. Only then, you see your misatakes.</p>
					<p>That's too slow.</p>
					<p>This service solves this problem. Everyday, in the morning or at night - whichever you prefer - you write a 200-250 word text in Spanish. We receive it, correct it and send you the correction in the next 24 hours.</p>
					<h4>This includes:</h4>
					<ul class="st-product-detail">
						<li><span>The correction of a 200-250 word text in Spanish, <span>per day,</span> written by you</span></li>
						<li>You'll get the correction in <span>24 hours</span></li>
						<li>Detailed explainations</li>
						<li>Differences between Spanish and English</li>
						<li>The correct way to write what you meant</li>
						<li>Alternative ways to say what you said</li>
						<li>Informal ways to say what you said</li>
					</ul>
					<p>When speaking during a call, the goal isn't to correct every single you say, rather it is to make you practice what you learned.<br>Through text, the goal is to learn to write phrases that sound right. Phrases that a native speaker might say.</p>
					<p>This is NOT to learn proper grammar. This is to improve how natural your phrases sound like.</p>
					<!--<p>The service we recommend is the daily one (28 to 31 days a month, dependind on the month and how many days there are)</p>
					<p>There is also the 'Monday-to-Friday' option, or the 'Weekend' option for busy people.</p>-->
