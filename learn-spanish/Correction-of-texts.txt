Correction of texts - Option 1:

For an automatic recurring payment of PRICE, I will correct one text, written in Spanish, written by you on every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, if you write and send me one. You will receive the corrected text within 48 hours.

I will write at least 1 comment that will come with the correction.

I will do up to 2 more corrections of the same text, for the same day if you ask me to.

Depending on the month, 20 to 23 texts will be corrected (it depends on how many days there is in the current month, and how many days it has excluding weekends)


Cancelling and Refunds

You can cancel the service anytime, you will continue receiving the service for the month you already paid for..

If you want a refund for a month that has not started yet, you can get a full refund if you ask at least 5 days in advance.

If the month has already started, you can cancel the service and ask for a full refund, minus $4 USD per text corrected. 10% be deduced from the refund to cover administrative fees.

If for any reason you are unable to to send a text you wrote on a given day, you can send it on a Saturday or Sunday. You can only do this with 2 texts per week, If it happens with more than 2 texts the other texts will not be corrected.


-------------------------------------------------

9 + 8 + 8 + 10 + 8 + 8 + 10 + 8 + 9 + 9 + 8 + 10 = how many week-end days in the year 2017 = 105.
105 weekend days / 12 months = 8.75 weekend days per month.
Price at 4$ per text = $4 * 8.75 = [$35 per month.]
